# PathfinderToolkit
This is a web application for Gamemasters and Players of Pathfinder 2e.

## Overview

The application currently provides a resource page for Gamemasters and Players, with plans to include an encounter tracker, a player stat and inventory tracker, and a dice roller for use in-game.

## Technologies Used

The application is built using ASP.NET MVC 6.0 and uses the Newtonsoft library for working with JSON databases.


## Usage

To use the application, simply navigate to the resource page and browse the available resources.

## Roadmap
This site is under heavy construction. Currently working on creating user login and continuing adding resources.
TODO: next stage will be adding ability to store encounter data to store sets of npc's with descriptions and stat tracker.
Player page with stat and inventory tracking to come later.
